# SignReader
This application uses Leap Motion Technology to capture sign language and output text. In the future this text can be put into text-to-speech software and can be used in emergency situations where someone who has trouble with speech or hearing can communicate with those who don't know sign language.

SignReader was built at HackRU Spring 2015
